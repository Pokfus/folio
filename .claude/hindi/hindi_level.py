"""Which Hindi level is being built, where its intermediates go, and what its list IS.

ONE LEVEL PER RUN.  `LEVEL` is read once, at import, from `HINDI_LEVEL` -- the
arrangement every pipeline here uses (`torfl_level`, `ukbi_level`).  Every
intermediate a stage writes is suffixed with the level (`f()`).

WHAT THE LIST IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT.  Hindi has no exam board that publishes a
graded word list -- no DELE, HSK or Goethe of its own -- so, like the UKBI
Indonesian and TORFL Russian decks, these decks are ASSEMBLED (the owner's
decision, 2026-11-09): a hand-written inventory of each level's topics
(`inventory.py`), then the commonest remaining words of everyday Hindi by lemma
frequency (`select.py`).  Each level is scoped to the Council of Europe's CEFR
global descriptor for its band, and the deck's description says both things in
plain words.  The plan is `docs/hindi-decks-plan.md`.

THE TITLES ARE ENGLISH and carry the CEFR band, so `levelRank` in
`.claude/build-lang-decks.js` sorts them with no new rule; the script deck's
title carries "Alphabet" and sorts before A1 by the rule Russian added.
