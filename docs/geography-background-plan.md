# The World geography backgrounds — a rewrite plan

*Opened Sep 2026, on request: "the background sections of geography cards that are not the United States
or US-controlled … should never mention the United States or the card's relationship with it. No
geography card should ever mention any information in its background section that is already mentioned in
its data grid or data about the country it's in. Background sections should primarily mention its
geography, climate, and history."*

**READ THIS BEFORE REWRITING A `gw-` BACKGROUND.** The three rules above are one job, and the job is
larger than it looks from any one card. This file states how large, why, what has already shipped, and
the batches the rest of it wants.

## What is wrong, measured

Run these against `data.js` rather than trusting the figures below; they were taken on 2026-09-06.

| | |
|---|---|
| `gw-` cards | 468 |
| …whose background mentions the United States | **419** |
| mean share of a background's sentences that do | **31%** |
| …that are the United States or a US territory, and legitimately may | 7 |
| cards citing `history.state.gov` | 406 |
| facts-grid figures repeated verbatim in a background | **205** |
| …whose background mentions any landscape or climate word at all | 119 |

The cause is not carelessness, it is the SOURCE. The collection was written from the Office of the
Historian's *Guide to the United States' History of Recognition, Diplomatic, and Consular Relations, by
Country* — which is the one openable work with a page for every state on earth, and which is the reason
the collection could be written at all (see the C7 finding in `docs/glossary-citation-plan.md`). It is
written from the American point of view, so a background written out of it is a history of *American
recognition of* the country rather than a history *of* the country. `gw-008` Bangladesh is the clearest
case: nine of its ten sentences are about Washington's hesitation, Nixon's message and the date an
American consulate opened.

## The three rules, and what each costs

1. **No United States, on a card that is not one.** Seven cards are exempt by subject — `gw-003` the
   United States and the six territories it administers. On the other 412 the American material has to
   come out, and it is a third of the prose, so what replaces it is not an edit but new research.
2. **Nothing the data grid already says.** `facts` prints Capital, Population, Largest city and Area
   under the answer term; 205 backgrounds print one of those figures again. A background repeating the
   grid is spending a tenth of its 300 words saying what is already on screen two inches above.
3. **Geography, climate and history first.** Only 119 of 468 backgrounds mention a landscape or climate
   word at all. This is the positive half of rule 1 and the one that makes the collection worth studying:
   a card asking a reader to recognise a shaded country should tell them what that country IS.

## Why this is not one batch

A `gw-` background is ten sentences at the house length (270–330 words) carrying **five citations** at
`SRC_TARGET`, every one with an openable URL. Removing a third of the sentences ORPHANS the citations
that stood on them, and `add-sources.js` refuses a batch with a source nothing points at — correctly. So
each card needs: new reading, new prose, a new source list, and the marker pass. That is the shape of
every content pass in `docs/`, and at 412 cards it is the largest one Folio has opened.

**Do not attempt it by find-and-replace.** A background with its American sentences deleted is a
four-sentence background under a five-source apparatus, which is worse than what is there now: it reads
as finished and is not.

## The sources the rewrite rests on

The recognition guide stays — for the ONE thing it is good for on these cards, which is the independence
date in the third sentence, and where the country page states it rather than a recognition date (see
C11's and C12's findings). What has to be added is the geography, and the passes above already record
what is reachable from this sandbox:

- **UNdata** (`data.un.org/en/iso/<cc>.html`) — the figures, and the Region field.
- **The World Bank indicator API** — `SP.POP.TOTL` for the population series and `AG.SRF.TOTL.K2` for
  surface area, which is a genuinely independent measurement (C9).
- **The EU country pages** and **the Commonwealth Secretariat** for the states each covers (C1, C4).
- For CLIMATE and LANDSCAPE, which none of the above carries: the open marine and earth-science
  literature the Korea collection's first ten cards were built on — Frontiers, Copernicus, PLOS, PMC —
  plus **UNESCO's World Heritage** entries where a country's landform is inscribed. `whc.unesco.org` is
  403 here and the Copernicus route is the way round it.

**Measure the reachability again before the first batch**; every one of those findings is dated.

## Batches

Fifteen batches of about 28, taking the collection in its own running order (which is by population, so
the countries a reader meets first are done first). Each batch:

1. Read the card, and grep its own `facts` figures out of the prose (rule 2 is mechanical and can be
   checked before any research).
2. Research the landscape, the climate and the country's own history to the citation bar.
3. Rewrite the ten sentences: **five on what the country is and where** — the landform, the water, the
   climate, the borders; **five on how it came to be** — the pre-colonial polity where there was one, the
   colonial period where there was one, the independence, and what has happened since.
4. `node .claude/add-sources.js`, then `node .claude/check-citations.js --prefix=gw-` BEFORE writing, per
   that script's own header.
5. Re-run the counts at the top of this file and record the new figures here.

**G-topup, first and separately:** rule 2 alone, over all 205 cards. It needs no research — the figure is
already on the card twice — so it can ship ahead of the rest and is the cheapest third of the job.

## What has shipped

- **2026-09-06.** The date lines: fifteen `gw-` cards carried a census count or a population figure in the
  key/value list under the answer term (`Census | 21,893,095 in 2020` on `gw-502` Beijing), and none does
  now. The rule is that a geography card's date line carries DATES; the population belongs in the facts
  grid, where the card already prints it once.
- **2026-09-06.** Four facts-grid populations rounded to three significant figures — Beijing 21.89M →
  21.9M, Jakarta 11.14M → 11.1M, Moscow 13.27M → 13.3M, Tokyo 14.26M → 14.3M. Those were the only four
  in the whole corpus over three; the three `+105.1%` rows on `gw-575`, `gw-625` and `gw-673` are
  population GROWTH rates rather than population figures and are left as they are.
- **2026-09-06.** Two pictures: `gw-008` Bangladesh (the old one was a moored boat filling the frame,
  photographed at Kaikhali on the INDIAN side of the Sundarbans) and `gw-507` Brasília (a 14,177 × 1,820
  panorama — a 7.8∶1 strip, which in the card's 16∶9 frame is a sliver).

**Nothing of rules 1 and 3 has shipped.** 419 cards still mention the United States.
