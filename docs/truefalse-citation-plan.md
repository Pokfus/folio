# Citing True or False

The fourth citation pass, after the cards', the glossary's and the artefacts'. It is the smallest and
the easiest to leave half done, because a True-or-False statement is one sentence and looks as though it
does not need an apparatus.

It does. The explanation is the only thing a reader of that game is ever told about the claim, they meet
it once and never again, and **a bare "True." is exactly the feedback the learning-science batch
measured at d = 0.05** — the weakest thing a test can hand back. What the same review rates highest is
an explanation, so the explanation is where the effort goes, and an explanation that asserts a fact with
nothing behind it is the one thing this site must not produce.

## The bar

**At least one openable source per statement**, cited in the site's Chicago note form and pointed at by
an empty `<sup class="fn" data-fn="N">` marker in the `why`. That is lower than a card's five and lower
than a glossary term's two, deliberately: a statement makes ONE claim, and the second source a card
needs is for its second through tenth sentences.

Everything else is the house rule already written down for cards and glossary terms and is not restated
here — real scholarship, never Wikipedia, never an invented page number, a URL a reader can open, and a
**foreign-language work under its own untranslated title** where it carries what an English one does
not. Read the `sources` bullet under "Add a card" in `CLAUDE.md` before opening a batch.

Two rules are this pool's own:

- **The prose is authored metric-first, in British spelling.** `unitizeTree` and `spellTree` are
  standing observers over the document, so a statement written `100 metres (330 feet)` in `colour` is
  shown to each reader in their own system and spelling — and one written in feet, or in `color`, is
  shown that way to *everybody*, the spelling transform being one-way from authored British.
  `check-truefalse.js` refuses both.
- **A statement may not be cited to a source that does not carry its claim.** This sounds like it goes
  without saying and is the pass's commonest failure: the reusable material here is Folio's own verified
  citations, and a citation reused for a claim it was not written for is the exact fault
  `docs/glossary-citation-plan.md` records three times over.

## Where the material is

**Folio's own corpus first.** A True-or-False statement is usually a claim some card already makes, and
that card's citation was opened, read and checked when the card was written. The recipe:

1. Find the card whose abstract states the claim.
2. Read which MARKER stands on that sentence — `<sup class="fn" data-fn="3">` means source 3.
3. Take source 3's string out of the card's own `sources` array **by index, programmatically**, never by
   retyping it.

`scratchpad/tf/build_n1.py` is that script. **Nothing is retyped**, which is the whole point: a citation
retyped is a citation whose DOI, page range or given name can drift from the one that was verified.

Where the corpus has nothing, the source is researched from scratch and the ordinary rules apply —
verify the DOI against Crossref while drafting (`node .claude/check-citations.js`), curl the URL, and
**read the source's own metadata page before composing an edition or an author list**, a curl being a
check of the address and of nothing else.

## Standing

Run `node .claude/check-truefalse.js` for the figures rather than quoting any here — it reports the
coverage per run. When this file was written the pool stood at **220 statements, 48 of them cited**, and
the cited ones were the whole of the new "Prehistory" category plus what could be lifted out of the
Ancient, Chinese-history, Modern-history, Biology, Earth-science and Medicine cards.

## Batches

Each batch is one category, because a category's statements draw on one part of the corpus and the
card-side research is then shared.

| batch | category | note |
|---|---|---|
| T1 | Prehistory | **done** — written cited |
| T2 | Ancient & classical | part done; Greece and Rome cards carry most of it |
| T3 | Chinese history | part done; `cnh-` cards carry most of it |
| T4 | Modern history | part done |
| T5 | Medieval & early modern | nothing in the corpus yet — research |
| T6 | Science & invention | the hardest; see the three below |
| T7 | Biology / Medicine | `bio-` and `ps-` cards carry some |
| T8 | Physics / Chemistry / Mathematics | little in the corpus; research |
| T9 | Astronomy / Earth science | little in the corpus; research |
| T10 | Psychology | `ps-` cards carry some |

## Open questions carried forward

Three statements are known to need work and are recorded here rather than left to be rediscovered.

- **The terracotta army's discovery (1974).** No source openable from this sandbox was found for the
  discovery itself; the statement is uncited.
- **Who built the Giza pyramids.** The obvious sources are Harvard's Giza project
  (`gizamedia.rc.fas.harvard.edu`, 502 through the proxy on every attempt), an ISAC Chicago PDF (404)
  and Cambridge Core (partially down). **Left uncited rather than cited to something unread**, which is
  the right answer and is why it is written down.
- **Gunpowder.** The statement asserts a Tang-dynasty origin and "the earliest known formula in a
  9th-century Taoist text". **Folio's own `wh-530` supports neither**: its cited prose gives the
  *Wujing zongyao* of 1044. Either a source is found for the earlier claim or **the statement is
  rewritten to what the corpus can stand behind** — and the second is the honest default.

One correction already made, worth keeping as the shape of the fault: a statement dated papermaking to
the 2nd century BCE, which the card cited for it does not say.

## Writing a batch

Build it in `scratchpad/<batch>/build.py`, emit the writer's own shape —

```json
{ "cite": { "<the statement's exact q>": { "why": "…<sup class=\"fn\" data-fn=\"1\"></sup>", "src": ["…"] } },
  "add":  [ { "q": "…", "a": true, "why": "…", "cat": "…", "src": ["…"] } ] }
```

— and apply it with `node .claude/add-truefalse.js <batch.json>`, which validates everything before
writing a byte and runs the checker afterwards. **The key is the statement's own `q`, never its index**,
so a batch cannot be applied to the wrong statement by a reordering that happened in between.

Then read the finished statements back as a reader: `node .claude/test-truefalse.js`, and the game
itself at `#truefalse`.
